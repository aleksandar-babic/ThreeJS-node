##### GNU/Linux distributions must have installed packages libcairo2-dev, libjpeg-dev, libgif-dev in order to get GL node module working.
### How to for Debian based distros (including *buntu, Linux Mint, Elementary OS, etc.)
```bash
    sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev
```
### How to for RHEL based distros (including CentOS)
